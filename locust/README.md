We test project and Backend endpoints of Go and Node.js and compare them as bellow:
In total they have no big difference, but in a lot of tests Go was better than Node.js.

We Share Images and Statistics and Graphs as bellow to compare them more specificly:
Actually we should consider the situation of eximination that this images and test are with **1000 Total Users to Simulate** and **Hatch Rate of 100** and also we should say that project on virtual machine (Ubuntu) has been ran with **2 GB RAM** and **a pice of Core i7 CPU of computer**.

Finally in differet tests with different rates, at every examination we run `htop` command to watch the **Memory** and **CPU** every moment. Image of one of them is shown bellow.
